However, we will be using an extension to excel built to automate tasks.
**Visual Basic for Applications** in short, **VBA** is a programming language which interacts with excel. It can read and write cells in worksheets make calculations and uses complex project to perform analysis. Using code through automated analysis allows to reuse it to any stock analysis and finally to create an interface to allow the users to perform functions with a click of a button.
